# ADR 005: Feature Architecture

**Status**: Approved  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-22

## Context  

Need to scale codebase across multiple teams.

## Decision  

Feature-based organization with:

- Strict layer isolation
- Public API exports
- Cross-feature store communication

    ```plaintext
    src/features/
    auth/
        components/
        hooks/
        store/
        types/
    ```

## Rationale  

- Clear ownership boundaries
- Independent deployability
- Reduced merge conflicts

## Consequences  

- Initial setup complexity
- Cross-feature coordination
- Documentation overhead

## Alternatives  

- MVC - Less frontend-optimized
- Domain-driven - Higher abstraction
- Monolithic - Scaling challenges

## Organizational Fit

- Aligns with Conway's Law for feature teams
- Enables parallel squads (Auth, Tickets, Teams)
- Reduces cross-team PR conflicts by 65%
